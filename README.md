# 42_cub3d

Introduction
------------

Welcome to our Cub3d project! Dagmar Kramer and myself worked together as a team to create a simple 3D game using raycasting techniques. Our game is inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D, and we've added some fun features to make it our own.

In this project, we've used the C programming language and the miniLibX graphics library to build the game from scratch.

We're excited to share our project with you. Please feel free to explore the code and leave us any feedback you have.

Usage
------------

run 'make'

run './cub3D maps/codam.cub' to run the game (or use another map!)

use the WASD keys and arrow keys to move and look around
