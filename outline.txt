main()
	-   check arg count
	-	read_map()
		Reads ENTIRE map file into memory as char **
		This includes the configuration data
	-	map_extract_config()
		Store map configuration data in char **
		Store it in its own struct, or as part of t_game
		Map config char ** will have 6 strings/char arrays, and a 7th for \0
		Iterate over each empty array element and give it the corresponding value in map.
		mlx->map_config[0] <- map[0]
		mlx->map_config[1] <- map[1]
		etc. until mlx->map_config[7] <- '\0'
	-	map_check_config()
		Checks if the data in mlx->map_config[] is correct.
		I.e.	Check if there are entries for NO, SO, WE, EA, F, C
				Only 1 entry per config category is allowed. So only 1 times should you
				specify the floor color. etc.
		If something is wrong, return 1

		If something is wrong, return 1
	-	map_check_floodfill()
